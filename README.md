# Dense Trade Routes Tab mod

## Overview

This is a mod that tries to change the trade routes tab to a more compact version. Please report any instability issues (crashes etc.) that you encounter because of this mod.

There are two versions: the main one uses an icon with a tooltip to indicate whether a certain good has player-owned trade routes. The alternate version uses a text alert.

**Compatibility**: This mod should be compatible with any mod that doesn't change the Trade Routes panel.

## Installation

To install the main version, copy the "Dense Trade Routes Tab" folder into your "%User%/Documents/Paradox Interactive/Victoria 3/mod/" folder.

To install an alternate version, copy the "Dense Trade Routes Tab (Alternate Text Version)" folder into your "%User%/Documents/Paradox Interactive/Victoria 3/mod/" folder.
